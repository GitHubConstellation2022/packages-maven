This repository can be used as a reference guide/sample to enable your first maven package publish to GitHub Packages registry for maven.

# Publishing
- For publishing via workflow, as added [here](https://github.com/GitHubConstellation2022/packages-maven/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-maven.yml) it is very straight forward process, check out the workflow.
- For publishing manually, you will have to modify `~/.m2/settings.xml` for authentication, follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages)

# Installing
- Add the package dependencies to the dependencies element of your project pom.xml file, replacing com.packages-maven:packages-maven with your package.

```
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.packages-maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>test</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
- Install the package.

`$ mvn install`
